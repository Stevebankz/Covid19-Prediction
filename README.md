## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, and predicting its future spread can provide valuable insights to inform decision-making and public health measures. This project uses linear regression, a statistical modeling technique, to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases based on historical data.

## Dataset

The prediction model relies on a carefully curated dataset of COVID-19 cases. The dataset should include relevant features such as the number of cases, dates, and potentially other factors that may influence the spread of the virus (e.g., population density, interventions implemented, etc.).

Please ensure that your dataset is reliable, up-to-date, and obtained from reputable sources such as health organizations or official government reports.

## Installation

To run the prediction model locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd covid19-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:

   - Ensure your dataset is in a suitable format, such as a CSV file, with the required columns and data.
   - If necessary, preprocess the dataset by cleaning missing values, normalizing data, and performing feature engineering.

2. Train the linear regression model:

   - Run the training script:

     ```
     python train.py --data <path_to_dataset.csv>
     ```

3. Make predictions:

   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new data or future time periods:

     ```
     python predict.py --model <path_to_trained_model.pkl> --data <path_to_new_dataset.csv>
     ```

   - The predictions will provide estimates of the number of COVID-19 cases based on the trained linear regression model.

## Results

The accuracy of the predictions is influenced by several factors, including the quality and quantity of the dataset, the chosen features, and the assumptions made in the linear regression model. It is important to interpret the results with caution and consider them as estimations rather than definitive forecasts.

The project's results and insights can be presented in various formats, such as visualizations, statistical metrics, or comparative analyses with actual data.
